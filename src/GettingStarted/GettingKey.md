# Getting a Key
- Here's how to go through Krnl's new authentication system.

## How to Get A Key:
Krnl requires you to go through 5 Linkvertise checkpoints before getting your key.

This helps monetize Krnl and supports the developers.

- Head over to [https://cdn.krnl.place/getkey](https://cdn.krnl.place/getkey) to start.
- Complete the tasks that you are given and soon you'll be authenticated!
    - This should only take you 1 minute.
- Your key will last 24 hours. After it expires, you'll have to repeat this process. 

## How To Go Through Linkvertise:
- On the Linkvertise checkpoints, simply click `Free Access with Ads`, complete the given steps, and click `Continue`.

If you have a dynamic IP address, your key may expire before 24 hours due to your IP changing!
