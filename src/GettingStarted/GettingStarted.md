# Getting Started:

- Welcome to Krnl! Let's install the required files to run Krnl.
- If you already have these files installed, you can skip this step.

## Requirements:
Krnl needs a certain amount of programs/softwares in order to operate functionally. These are as follows:
- [x64 Bit Installation of Windows 10/11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
- [VC_Redist: x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- [VC_Redist: x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
- [.NET Framework: v4.7.2+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer)

## Check To Have x64 Bit Version of Windows 10/11:

                        This is the same process for both Windows 10/11!

## Check To Have VC_Redist's Installed:
- Press `Windows + R` on your keyboard to open Run. Type `appwiz.cpl` and press Enter.
    - A list of all your installed programs should show up.

- Find `Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable (x64)` and `(x86)`.
    - If you do not have them installed, click these two links: [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) [x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
    - You need both of these redistributable's, otherwise Krnl may not work.

## Check To Have .NET Installed:
- Run `Krnl.exe` / `krnlss.exe` (if you haven't already).
    - If you are missing the .NET Framework, Windows will automatically ask you to install it.
